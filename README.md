# Senior Research
Hello! This is my AET senior research project repository.

# Project Rationale
Years of space activity have led to the exponential accumulation of more than 500,000 pieces of man-made space debris that orbit the earth at speeds of 17,500 mph.â€¯ This high-speed debris can inflict significant damage upon space infrastructure responsible for GPS, World-Wide communications, and the internet. The issue of space debris warrants the development of a CubeSat mission simulation, detailing methods of identifying and capturing simulated space debris in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space environment. 

## Engineering Goals
1. The simulation of the tether-actuated pneumatic net launch system shall depict the net cast in a divergent manner such that it completely encapsulates the target space debris. The simulation must also depict a method by which the debris can be slowed down using a winch system. The Mesh net for the pneumatic net-capture device shall also have a minimum range of 1m and a diagonal of 2m.  

2. The target space debris, when slowed to a LEO deorbit velocity, shall completely burn up in the earth's atmosphere. Moreover, the debris shall be deorbited over a large body of water.   

3. The simulation of the dual-robotic gripper arms shall showcase a small "Chaser" CubeSat with robotic arms that are capable of at least four degrees of freedom. The "Chaser" CubeSat gripper arms shall sufficiently grip the debris, accounting for curved and irregular surfaces. The adhesive tips that will be added to the gripper arm simulation shall function in the LEO space environment.  

4. The telemetry data (e.g. temperature, altitude, roll, pitch, yaw) from the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT shall be within 5% of true values.   

5. The detection software shall detect space debris with an accuracy of 95%.    

6. The orbital path defined (in AGI STK) for the CubeSat shall target dense areas of space debris containing debris that is at least 1m in diameter.
